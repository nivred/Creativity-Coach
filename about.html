                <h2>About the Coach</h2>
                <p>Brendan Sullivan is a creativity coach. He helps organizational teams, leaders and individuals to create more
                    innovative solutions, more successful creative ideas, and a healthier, more collaborative work environment 
                    where talented people can flourish.</p>
                <p>Brendan has designed, facilitated and presented his programs to a wide range of clients, including large 
                    corporations like Kellogg’s, Harley-Davidson, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Sara Lee, Jenny Craig, PepsiCo, Aetna, 
                    Marriott Hotels and many others, as well as to many smaller companies, nonprofit groups, schools and 
                    government agencies.</p>
                <p>Brendan’s programs are informed by his lifetime of practical experience in the corporate world, as well as 
                    the world of applied creativity and innovation.</p>
                <p>Brendan has been a professional improvisational performer for over 25 years, a graduate of the world famous 
                    Second City Conservatory. He has also been a director, teacher and coach of other improvisers. Successful 
                    improvisation is all about innovating and collaborating in the moment. Brendan’s nationally recognized, 
                    award winning improv group “Blue Velveeta” toured the country, creating new theatre in the moment every 
                    night, and on cable’s A&amp;E. Brendan still performs improv on stage in Chicago on a weekly basis.</p>
                <p>Brendan’s first novel, &quot;<a href="novel.html">The Living Wills</a>,&quot; was published by Eckhartz Press
                    in 2011.</p>
                <p>Brendan also was the creative producer, for 10 years, of a top-rated morning radio show in Chicago, the 
                    Jonathon Brandmeier Radio Showgram. His job was to create material for the show, written pieces, creative 
                    ideas and humorous character segments. Brendan developed successful, transferable techniques for generating 
                    creative ideas quickly.</p>
                <p>Before all this, Brendan had a ‘real job.’ He sold advertising for a living, including five years with the 
                    New York Times Magazine Group as Midwest Advertising Sales Manager of Family Circle’s special interest 
                    magazines. He led a sales team and his clients were national accounts, mainly Fortune 500 consumer products 
                    companies. Brendan took a lot of people to lunch and played a lot of golf. His experience gave Brendan 
                    valuable insights into the corporate world, work teams, leadership, productivity and management.</p>
                <p>Brendan has combined his extensive experience in improvisation, creative thinking and the corporate world 
                    to create and lead engaging, entertaining, practical workshops, keynotes and seminars around collaborative 
                    innovation, creativity, team and leadership development.</p>
                <p>Brendan is an active member of the Chicago chapter of the Association for Talent Development. He has also 
                    presented his programs to his colleagues in the Midwest Facilitators Network and the Association for 
                    Experiential Education. Brendan is an approved provider of continuing professional development for the 
                    Illinois State Board of Education.</p>
                <p>As an actor, Brendan has appeared in national television commercials, feature films, television productions 
                    and the theater. He is a member of the Screen Actors Guild. Brendan has also written speech for corporate 
                    clients, scripts which were produced for television and the stage, as well as feature articles in magazines 
                    and advertising copy for business publications and radio commercials.</p>
